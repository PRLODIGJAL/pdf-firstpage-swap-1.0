rem  This file is deliberately pure ASCII. Batch files are decoded
rem  by cmd.exe with the console codepage, which differs between
rem  machines; all logic and all Chinese messages live in
rem  setup_env.py, where the encoding is guaranteed.
rem
rem  No parenthesised blocks are used on purpose: "if errorlevel"
rem  inside a block is a classic source of surprises.
